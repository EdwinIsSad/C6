      Future
     </h2>
    <p style="font-size:18px;"> It's pretty crazy how were on our path to graduation, huh, makes you think on how fast time goes on.<br>I plan on attending the University of Texas at Austin for <i>Computer Science</i> (I plan to major in it).<br> 
      Sleeping is another thing I look towards to, I love sleeping especially if it is on the weekend when I get to stay in bed after I wake up.<br>Eating food at home after today is good 
      as well because I find school food gross. On the more serious note though, <br> I look forward to graduating high school with my friends and hopefully going out with them more often. :D </p>
